## Overview
I am studing web development in Udemy, and i am really happy for finding a way to test my knowledge

## My process
At the beginning i tried to complete the challenge using html and basic css, it took more time than i thought and i could not finish it, than i decided to do it applying bootstrap properly the card property, i had troubles using padding in the img, and i found it difficult to make the div wrap the img, i google about it and found the objet-fit property in w3schools which helped a lot.


### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS custom properties
-Bootstrap


### What I learned

I lernt how to use the objet-fit property.


### Continued development

I need more pratice using padding property.
